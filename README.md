Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
======
An unofficial implementation of DDPM in PyTorch.
We provide the following coverage:
- Training on mnist, fashion-mnist, cifar10, and celeba
Notes:
- Quality of images in Images folder is lower than expected because models were trained to T=1000, but images were generated in T=100.

## Requirements
Download the requiremenets.txt file which contains the required packages including:
- PyTorch
- numpy
- matplotlib
